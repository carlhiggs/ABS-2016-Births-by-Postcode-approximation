# ABS-2016-Births-by-Postcode-approximation
Data on births by postcode may not be available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, however some disease incidence data is only available for postcodes.  This code relates data on persons aged zero at the 2016 census for Australian postcodes to Queensland open data on births by mother's postcode of residence to see if it matches well.
